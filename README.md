<h1>NYC Evictions 2017-2022</h1>
This analysis focuses on New York City eviction data from 2017-2022. Providing solutions to problems of eviction rates before, during, and after the coronavirus pandemic. This project was created as part of a team effort. My portion consisted of analyzing the NYC Marshals listed in the dataset. My analysis included the volume of evictions over a given time as well as location of evictions.

<h2>Ask</h2>

- What role do marshals play in the eviction and repossession process?
- Where are the most evictions taking place and why?
- How have eviction rates changed from year to year?

<h2>Prepare</h2>

- This dataset is openly accessible to the public via [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/about_data).
- Data collected by NYC Housing Authority to document pending, scheduled, and executed evictions within the five boroughs.
- Efforts to clean this third-party data were made as a team.

<h2>Process</h2>

- Cleaned data using functions in Excel.
- Removed duplicate rows, trimmed whitespace, and fixed a spelling error in a Marshal's name.
- Split the Marshals' first and last names into separate columns.
- Applied conditional formatting to empty cells for easy visualization. 

<h2>Analyze</h2>

<h3>Insight 1</h3>

- During my analysis, I discovered that marshals operating within the five boroughs weren't government employees, but private contractors hired by the City to execute evictions and other civil matters.
- Eviction rates in NYC pre-pandemic estimated over 22,000 in 2017.

- By the start of 2020, they dropped dramatically due in part to eviction moratoriums placed at the time which allowed tenants who would have otherwise faced eviction to remain in their dwellings.
- Evictions steadily increased once more after the post-moratorium period starting in 2022.

<h3>Insight 2</h3>

- Curious about the financial incentive of evictions and repossessions, I analyzed a [new dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Marshals-Revenue/7ewi-9cdf/about_data) outlining the revenue City marshals generate from evictions and possessions.

![adjgrossiincom vs netincome marshals chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e1c9aa-a7ed-447b-9463-674dfafa71db)

- NYC marshals in the 2017-2022 period collected over $105 million in gross poundage and fees, and over $39 million in net income.
- Marshals' net income varied among individual marshals, but 17 out of 28 NYC marshals made over a million dollars in net income.
- Evictions have a steep financial incentive, exacerbating an already high-intensity situation for evictees.

- Total evictions per marshal by borough.
- Bronx has the highest number of evictions, while Staten Island has the lowest.
- Most marshals' evictions and possessions occur out of their home borough.
- Marshals are prohibited from operating outside the five boroughs and are subject to sanctioning by the Department of Investigation if caught doing so.

<h2>Act</h2>

<h3>Results</h3>

- With rent burdens increasing, more households were pushed to the brink of eviction.
- [Renters spent over 30% of their income on rent](https://council.nyc.gov/data/evictions/), leading to increased housing instability.
- With most renters unable to afford expensive legal representation, the likelihood of eviction for low-income renters increases.
- Evictions plummeted due to COVID-19 eviction moratoriums at the state and federal levels. 
- Many landlords filed for evictions after the moratorium ended, and housing instability returned.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

- Reinvest in converting the job of NYC marshals from a private contractor to a civil servant subject to more government regulation.
- Or reinvest in adding social workers to be present at evictions as advocates for the evictees.
- Implement policies to strengthen tenant protections and offer stronger legal representation, especially in low-income areas.
- Provide support for tenants still recovering from the economic effects of the pandemic.
- Establish community-based eviction protection programs that proactively help tenants avoid eviction before reaching crisis points.
